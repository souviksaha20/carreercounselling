                              <p style="text-align:justify;">Artistic people are naturally creative, sensitive and innovative. These people tend to work well in the field of arts but also thrive in other areas that lend to abstract thinking and concepts.</p>
                               <p style="text-align:justify;">Artistic individuals are original, intuitive and imaginative and enjoy creative activities, such as composing or playing music, writing, drawing or painting and acting in or directing stage productions. They seek opportunities for self expression through artistic creation. People who fall into this category prefer flexibility and ambiguity and have an aversion to convention and conformity. Artistic types are generally impulsive and emotional and tend to communicate in a very expressive and open manner. They value aesthetics and view themselves as creative, non-conforming and as appreciating or possessing musical, dramatic, artistic or writing abilities while lacking clerical or organizational skills. The preferred work environment of the artistic type fosters creative competencies, and encourages originality and use of the imagination in a flexible, unstructured setting. Typical artistic careers include musician, reporter and interior decorator.</p>
