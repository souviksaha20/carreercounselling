                              <p style="text-align:justify;">People that are identified as "realistic" are generally more independent and stable than their peers. They tend to prefer working with things rather than people and value the outdoors and nature in their work.</p>
                               <p style="text-align:justify;">Realistic individuals are active and stable and enjoy hands-on or manual activities, such as building, mechanics, machinery operation and athletics. They prefer to work with things rather than ideas and people. They enjoy engaging in physical activity and often like being outdoors and working with plants and animals. People who fall into this category generally prefer to "learn by doing" in a practical, task-oriented setting, as opposed to spending extended periods of time in a classroom. Realistic types tend to communicate in a frank, direct manner and value material things. They perceive themselves as skilled in mechanical and physical activities but may be uncomfortable or less adept with human relations. The preferred work environment of the realistic type fosters technical competencies and work that allows them to produce tangible results. Typical realistic careers include electrician, engineer, veterinarian and the military.</p>
