                              <p style="text-align:justify;">Conventional thinkers are logical and efficient workers that prefer practicality to creativity in any task. Order and structure are traits for this individual, which makes them excellent in math-related work alongside clerical work.</p>
                               <p style="text-align:justify;">Conventional individuals are efficient, careful, conforming, organized and conscientious. They are comfortable working within an established chain of command and prefer carrying out well-defined instructions over assuming leadership roles. They prefer organized, systematic activities and have an aversion to ambiguity. They are skilled in and often enjoy maintaining and manipulating data, organizing schedules and operating office equipment. While they rarely seek leadership or “spotlight” roles, they are thorough, persistent and reliable in carrying out tasks. Conventional types view themselves as responsible, orderly and efficient, and possessing clerical, organizational and numerical abilities. They may also see themselves as unimaginative or lacking in creativity. The preferred work environment of the conventional type fosters organizational competencies, such as record keeping and data management, in a structured operation and places high value on conformity and dependability. Typical conventional careers include secretary, accountant and banker.</p>
